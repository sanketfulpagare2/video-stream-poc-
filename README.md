How Video Streaming Works
Video streaming works by sending video data over the internet in small packets. These packets are then reassembled on the user's device and played back in real-time. This allows users to watch videos without having to wait for the entire video to download. Video streaming services use specialized servers to deliver video content to users, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted viewing experience.

Role of Codecs in Video Streaming
Codecs play a crucial role in video streaming by compressing and decompressing video data. They help reduce the size of video files, making it easier to transmit them over the internet. Common video codecs include H.264, H.265, and VP9. Choosing the right codec is essential for ensuring high-quality video streaming with minimal buffering.

M3U8 is a common format used for streaming video content over the internet. It is widely supported by video streaming services and allows for adaptive bitrate streaming, which adjusts the video quality based on the user's internet connection speed.

Role of ffmpeg in Video Streaming
FFmpeg is so far the only open-source software that can handle almost all video and audio formats. It is a powerful tool for video processing and streaming, allowing users to convert, edit, and stream video content. FFmpeg supports a wide range of codecs and formats, making it a versatile tool for video streaming applications.
